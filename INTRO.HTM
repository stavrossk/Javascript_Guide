            JavaScript is a compact, object-based scripting language
            for developing client and server Internet applications.
            Netscape Navigator interprets JavaScript statements embedded in an HTML page,
            and LiveWire enables you to create server-based applications
            similar to Common Gateway Interface (CGI) programs.
            This book describes the JavaScript language and its use in Navigator.
            For information on developing server-based JavaScript applications,
            see the

            <LI>

                Part&nbsp;1, "Using JavaScript in Navigator,"
                introduces JavaScript and describes its use in Navigator.
                It covers the main features of client JavaScript
                and touches on some advanced topics.

        </A>


        <A NAME="1002938">

            <LI>

                Part&nbsp;2, "The JavaScript languag,"
                describes the syntax and semantics of the JavaScript language
                itself and is applicable to both client-side and server-side JavaScript.
                It also describes JavaScript's built-in
                <I>String, Math,</I> and <I>Date</I> objects,
                built-in functions, and statement syntax.

        <A NAME="1002939">

            <LI>

                Part&nbsp;3, "Reference," is a comprehensive,
                alphabetical reference for Navigator JavaScript.
                It includes a chapter on JavaScript statements and one for all objects,
                properties, and methods in Navigator JavaScript.

        </A>

    <A NAME="1002944">

        If you are new to JavaScript,
        start with

        <a href="getstart.htm#996824">

            Chapter&nbsp;1, "Getting started"

        </a>

        to start scripting your own pages immediately.
        Then continue with the chapters in Part&nbsp;1,
        to learn more about JavaScript in Navigator.
        You may find it useful to skim the material in Part&nbsp;2,
        particularly

        <a href="model.htm#996824">

            Chapter&nbsp;8, "Object model."

        </a>

        Use the reference material in Part&nbsp;3
        as necessary for details on specific topics.

        <P>

    </A>



    <A NAME="1002206">

        If you are already familiar with JavaScript in Navigator,
        skim the material in Part&nbsp;1,
        paying particular attention to the chapters that discuss more advanced topics:

        <a href="windows.htm#996824">

            Chapter&nbsp;3,
            "Using windows and frames"

        </a>

        and

        <a href="advtopic.htm#996824">

            Chapter&nbsp;5,
            "Advanced topics."

        </a>

        You can then use the reference material as needed.

    <A NAME="1002197">

        If you are a LiveWire application developer,
        use the material in Part&nbsp;1
        to familiarize yourself with the basics of JavaScript.
        Then read Part&nbsp;2 for a more in-depth look at the JavaScript language.
        All the material in Part&nbsp;2 is applicable to LiveWire JavaScript.
        You need to read only material on client JavaScript
        if you want to incorporate only client functionality
        into your applications.

        Netscape Navigator runs on many different operating systems;
        the information here applies to all versions.
        File and directory paths are given in Windows format
        (with backslashes separating directory names).
        For Unix versions, the directory paths are the same,
        except slashes instead of backslashes separate directories.

        In these URLs, server represents the name of the server

        If you have configured your proxy, you might not need
        to specify your domain name when the client itself is within the domain.
        In general, italic items in URLs are variables,
